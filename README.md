# js-free-email-provider-check
A plain and simple solution to exclude free email providers from input fields.

Use this code to check, if a email address is from a free provider, to prevent spam requests.

All input fields with the class "email-freeprovider-check", will be checked. If the email is from a free provider, and error will be shown beside the input field. The submit button will also be disabled until the email is from paid provider. The submit button should have the class "submit-email-check".

Example code is only with a few examples of free providers. See this list for more free providers: https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856
